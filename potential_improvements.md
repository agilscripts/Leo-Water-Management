# Future Recommendations

As we look to enhance the Leo Project's water management system, here are some practical recommendations for the future:

## Cloud Integration

### AWS Cloud Migration

Consider moving the Node-RED Dashboard and MySQL database to the AWS cloud for scalability and security benefits. This allows easier access and reduces local infrastructure load.

### IAM Implementation

Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for robust security control, ensuring only authorized users can access resources.

### Dashboard Options

Explore AWS-native dashboards for real-time monitoring or deploy the existing Node-RED Dashboard within AWS.

## Sensor Integration

### Real Sensor Connectivity

Enhance data accuracy and insight by connecting real sensors to capture environmental data.

## Financial Database Integration

### Linking with Financial Data

Connect the Node-RED Dashboard to a financial database for informed financial planning and resource allocation.

## Continuous Improvement

### Monitoring and Optimization

Implement automated monitoring and periodic reviews to optimize system performance and workflows.
