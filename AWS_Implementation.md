## 1. Introduction

### Overview

This document provides a guide on deploying our Node-RED dashboard with AWS infrastructure, utilizing AWS EC2 for hosting Node-RED, RDS for MySQL database storage, and IAM for user authentication. The goal is to assist in setting up a secure and scalable environment.

### Purpose of this Document

This document serves as a reference for implementing the AWS infrastructure and securing access to the Node-RED dashboard.

## 2. AWS Setup

### Account Creation

1. If your organization does not have an AWS account, create one on the AWS Management Console.

### IAM User Setup

2. Create IAM users for individuals who will manage the AWS resources.

### IAM Role Setup

3. Configure an IAM role for the EC2 instance to access RDS and other AWS services securely.

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Configuration

4. Set up a VPC with appropriate subnets and route tables, ensuring secure network isolation.

## 3. EC2 Instance Setup

### Launching an EC2 Instance

5. Launch an EC2 instance, selecting the appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type.

6. Configure security groups to allow access to ports required by Node-RED and RDS.

### Installing Node-RED

7. Install Node-RED and its dependencies on the EC2 instance.

8. Start Node-RED and ensure it is accessible via a web browser.

### SSH Access to EC2 Instance

9. Configure SSH access to the EC2 instance using key pairs for secure remote management.

## 4. RDS MySQL Database

### Creating an RDS Instance

10. Create an RDS MySQL instance and configure necessary settings, including username and password.

### Configuring RDS Security Group

11. Set up security group rules for the RDS instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.

### Connecting Node-RED to RDS

12. Configure Node-RED to connect to the RDS MySQL database for data storage.

## 5. IAM User Authentication

### Creating IAM Users

16. Create IAM users for Node-RED access, each with a unique access key and secret key.

### Configuring IAM Policies

17. Define IAM policies to restrict user access to specific AWS resources, ensuring secure authentication.

### Securing Access to Node-RED

18. Implement IAM-based authentication in Node-RED to allow IAM users to log in securely.

## 6. Security and Best Practices

### EC2 Security Groups

19. Continuously monitor and update EC2 security groups to restrict access and enhance security.

### RDS Encryption

20. Enable encryption for the RDS instance to protect sensitive data at rest.

### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

21. Regularly review and update IAM policies and roles to maintain a secure environment.

### Backups and Data Management

22. Implement automated backups for RDS databases and establish data management best practices.
