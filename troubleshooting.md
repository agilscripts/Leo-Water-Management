# Troubleshooting Guide

Welcome to the Troubleshooting Guide for the Leo Project's water management system. This guide is designed to help you identify and resolve common issues related to Node-RED and the MySQL database. 

## Node-RED Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Node-RED Dashboard Not Loading

**Symptoms:** The Node-RED Dashboard is not loading, or you encounter a blank page when trying to access it.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Check Node-RED Status:** Ensure that Node-RED is running and operational. You can do this by accessing the Node-RED server via the provided URL.

2. **Browser Compatibility:** Verify that you are using a supported web browser. Node-RED is known to work well with modern browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

3. **Check Flow Configuration:** Review your Node-RED flow configurations to ensure there are no errors or missing nodes that might be causing issues with the dashboard.

### Issue 2: Data Inconsistencies

**Symptoms:** Data displayed on the Node-RED Dashboard appears to be inconsistent or incorrect.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Data Sources:** Check the data sources and sensors connected to Node-RED. Ensure that they are functioning correctly and providing accurate data.

2. **Data Processing:** Review your Node-RED flows responsible for data processing. Confirm that data is being processed accurately, and there are no issues with data transformation or calculations.

## MySQL Database Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Unable to Connect to the Database

**Symptoms:** You encounter connection errors when trying to access the MySQL database.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Database Credentials:** Double-check the database connection settings, including the hostname, port, username, and password. Ensure they are correctly configured in your Node-RED flows.

2. **Firewall and Network:** Verify that your server's firewall settings allow incoming connections to the MySQL database port. Ensure network connectivity to the database server.

### Issue 2: Data Import Failures

**Symptoms:** You experience difficulties when importing data into the MySQL database.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **SQL Syntax Errors:** Review the SQL data dump file for any syntax errors or issues. Correct any errors in the SQL script.

2. **Database Permissions:** Ensure that the database user has the necessary permissions to execute SQL statements and import data.
